# Placeholder website for Nice, too bad
A fun website created as part of an application process, that will eventually hold my freelance web development work.

# Tech
**HTML + <canvas>, SCSS, Vanilla Javascript**

# Future Work
- Canvas: Make the Canvas element more responsive (smaller particles)
- Canvas: Better collision algorithm for colliding particles
- Canvas: Only draw lines between particles that have collided, rather than it being a cumulation equation
